## Technical Details

StickyOverlay is built using Swift and AppKit, with a focus on lightweight performance and native macOS integration. Key components include:

- **AppDelegate**: Manages the menu bar item and sticky note creation
- **StickyNoteWindow**: Custom window implementation for sticky notes
- **PinTrayWindow**: Specialized window for the pin tray functionality
- **ColorCircleView**: Custom view for color selection

Notes are persisted using UserDefaults for simplicity, making this app perfect for quick reminders and thoughts without the overhead of a full note-taking application.

## Customization

You can customize the app by modifying the source code:

- Change the default colors in `AppDelegate.swift`
- Adjust the size and appearance of sticky notes in `StickyNoteWindow.swift`
